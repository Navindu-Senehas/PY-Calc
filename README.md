# PY-Calc 1.0
A simple calculator based on python

*(This is not made for everyday use, just little fun project)*

# NOTE
To make it work, you need to update the 10th, 11th, and 12th lines of the code:

- Replace the placeholder paths for the Moon-icon, Sun-icon, and History-icon with the actual paths to your icon files.
- You can use the icons provided in this repository or create your own.

Make sure you have [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) installed.
